  <div class="top-left" align="left" font size="24px" style="font-size:1.6vw;">For eight years, I served as an editor for a leading online journal of criticism,<br>
    managing a remote team while working with a stable of freelance writers to<br>
    produce a monthly magazine and daily essays.<br><br>
    I copy edited manuscripts for publishers such as Verso Books and Grove Press,<br> 
    and edited scholarly texts for publication with Duke University Press and Pluto <br>
    Press. For private clients, I have edited successful PhD dissertations and book <br>proposals.<br>
    <br>
    I conceived and built the online presence for an Emmy-nominated PBS series<br>
    about poverty in America.<br>
    <br>
    I fact-checked and edited copy for clients in the fashion and art worlds such as<br>
    V Magazine, Flash Art, and the Guggenheim Museum, as well as artists and<br>
    researchers such as Daniel Paul and Paolo Cirio.<br>
    <br>
    I wrote copy for clients in the technology, biomedical and finance world like<br>
    Glycomine, Sequentum, Amazon Web Services, Samsung, and HSBC.<br>
    <br>
    I translated a sci-fi memoir by the French theorist Guy Hocquenghem which <br>
    was a finalist for the 2020 Lambda Literary Award.
