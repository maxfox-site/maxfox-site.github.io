  <div class="top-left" align="left" style="font-size:5vw;">I am a writer, editor, and translator based in Philadelphia. 
<br>
<br>    
I am a founding editor of Pinko Magazine, the editor of Christopher Chitty’s <i>Sexual Hegemony: Statecraft, Sodomy and Capital in the Rise of the World-System</i> (Duke UP, 2020), and the translator of Guy Hocquenghem’s <i>The Amphitheater of the Dead</i>, which was a 2020 Lambda Literary Award nominee. Before that, I served as an editor for the New Inquiry from 2011–2018. My writing has appeared in Bookforum, the Nation, the Baffler, Lux, Parapraxis, and the New Republic, among other publications, often about the political or historical dimensions of sexuality. 
<br>
    <br>
I also work as a developmental editor, copy editor, proofreader, and indexer. I have served as a copy editor for print publications such as Tank and V Magazine, publishers like Verso and Inventory Press, and worked with private clients in academia, the arts, and architectural history to develop proposals, manuscripts, and successful grant applications. I have also worked as a ghostwriter to produce op-eds, exhibition text, and short books.
