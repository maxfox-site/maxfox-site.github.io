<p>About me</p>
<p>I am a writer, editor, and translator. I have over a decade of experience writing and editing copy, proofreading, fact-checking, ghostwriting, consulting and strategizing on texts for the public.</p>

<p>For eight years, I served as an editor for a <a href=“thenewinquiry.com”>leading online journal of criticism</a>, managing a remote team while working with a stable of freelance writers to produce a monthly magazine and daily essays.</p>

<p>I copy edited manuscripts for publishers such as Verso Books and Grove Press, and edited scholarly texts for publication with Duke University Press and Pluto Press. For private clients, I have edited successful PhD dissertations and book proposals.</p>

<p>I conceived and built the online presence for an <a href=“https://www.pbs.org/wnet/chasing-the-dream”>Emmy-nominated PBS series</a> about poverty in America.</p> 

<p>I fact-checked and edited copy for clients in the fashion and art worlds such as V Magazine, Flash Art, and the Guggenheim Museum, as well as artists and researchers such as Daniel Paul and Paolo Cirio.</p>

<p>I wrote copy for clients in the technology, biomedical and finance world like Glycomine, Sequentum, Amazon Web Services, Samsung, and HSBC.</p> 

<p>I translated a <a href=“https://www.guillotinepublishing.org/shop/guillotine-series-15-the-amphitheater-of-the-dead-guy-hocquenghem-translated-by-max-fox”>sci-fi memoir</a> by the French theorist Guy Hocquenghem with the independent publisher Guillotine Press.</p>
