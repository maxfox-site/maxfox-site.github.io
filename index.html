  <div class="top-left" align="left" font size="14px" style="font-size:1.6vw;">Max Fox is a writer, editor, and translator based in Philadelphia. 
<br>
    <br>
I am a founding editor of <i>Pinko</i> Magazine, the editor of Christopher Chitty’s <i>Sexual Hegemony: Statecraft, Sodomy and Capital in the Rise of the World-System</i> (Duke UP, 2020), and the translator of Guy Hocquenghem’s <i>The Amphitheater of the Dead</i>, which was a 2020 Lambda Literary Award nominee. Before that, I served as an editor for the <i>New Inquiry</i> from 2011–2018. My writing has appeared in <i>Bookforum</i>, the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>Baffler</i>, <i>Parapraxis</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, and the <i>New Inquiry</i>, among other publications, often about the political or historical dimensions of sexuality. 
<br>
    <br>
I also work as a developmental editor, copy editor, proofreader, and indexer. I have served as a copy editor for print outlets such as <i>Tank</i> and <i>V Magazine</i>, publishers like Verso and Inventory Press, and worked with private clients in academia, the arts, and architectural history to develop proposals, manuscripts, and successful grant applications. I have also worked as a ghostwriter to produce op-eds, exhibition text, and short books.
